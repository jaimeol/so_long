## Summary
In the so_long project at 42, we created a 2D game using the miniLibX graphic library. The objective was to develop a simple arcade-style game, where the player can move a character around a map and accomplish certain goals, such as collecting objects or avoiding obstacles.

## Implementation
We used C and the miniLibX library to develop the game, leveraging the graphic capabilities to create a visually appealing experience. We implemented the game logic, including player movement, interaction with map objects, and keyboard event handling.

## Future Update
I will update this project with the bonus part and some changes, due to the migration to linux in 42 Madrid I had to rush the correction of this project as it only worked in Mac. However in the future update I will provide a Linux available version with an updated Makefile and some major changes, until that I hope this version is useful for you.
